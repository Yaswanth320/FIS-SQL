Databases - SQL Server

Can be defined as the storage of inter related data that can be organised in such a fashion that the process of retrieving data is effective and efficient

Management System: A set of programs to access the data.
-An environment that is both convinient and efficient to use

Earlier database applications used to be built on top of the file system
 
Drawbacks : data redundancy and inconsistency
            difficulty in accessing data
            data isolation
            integrity problems
            concurrency problems
            security problems
            atomicity

Data Model :
  a collection of tools for describing
     - data
     - data relationships
     - data semantics
     - data constraints



HDBMS - Hierarchial database management system - Focus 4gl 
NDBMS - Network database management system
RDBMS - Relational database management
ORDBMS - support for multimedia and hypertext based databases

EF Codd - codds 12 rules
Chen - E R Diagrams (visual picture to depict the relations between various pieces of data)

 Data is organised as tables(relations) as rows and cols

-each column represents attributes (properties) viz. Name, address, zipcode, city
- all attributes put together in a relation are called as domain.
-number of columns/attributes is known as degree
-each row has values against the attributes 
- one row is called as a tuple
- no.of rows in a relation is known as cardinality
- number of 

Relating one entity with another using the concept of Primary key and foreign keys


Data Integrity in RDBMS (Integrity Constraints)
 - Entity Integrity - primary key, unique key
 - Domain Integrity - Datatype, length, defaults, nullable, checks etc
            null/not null, default, check
 - Rereferntial Integrity - Foreign Key

Relation Types : one-to -one
                 one to many
                 many to many

Primary Key : No duplicates and no Null values

Foreign key : Duplicates allowed, nulls are also allowed, can exists only when a primary key exists

//go to the search option in task bar and type run
it will give you atext box - type services.msc


Structured Query Lang (Sql)
5 components :
  1. DDL : Data Def. Lang ( Create, Drop, Alter,Truncate)
 2. DML : Data Manipulation Lang (Insert,Update,Delete)
  3. DQL : Data WQuery Lang. (Select)
 4. TCL: Transaction Control lang. (Rollback, Commit)
5. DCL:Data Control Lang. (Grant, Revoke)


Truncate           vs.            Delete

-DDL command                       DML command
-deletes all records               we can restrict records for deletion
  and we cannot restrict
-cannot rollback                   we can rollback if inside a transaction
-faster                            slower compared to truncate

similarites : both retain the structure

Relational Algebra :

Selection -  *
Restriction  -  using a predicate called 'where'
Projection   - column list
Join
Union
Difference
Divide

Operators Supported in select clause

-Arithmetic
-Relational
-Logical

Indexes : helpful to store and retrieve faster2 types : 1. Clustered Index : are applicable on the primary key. If there are no primary key defined, then we can create a unique clustered index
 - they sort the physical order. Every time there is any manipulation, it undergoes physical reordering of records
 - can have only one clustered index/table


2. Non-clustered index - can have as many as the no, of columns
 - they do not modify the existing table contents
 - they maintain a seperate index table, where the data is indexed and points to the data page of the original data
 - it occupies memory
