Fact Table : Stores quantitative information for analysis, and is often denormalized. It consists of 2 types of columns. The foreign key columns that connect to the dimension table, and the measures column that contains the data that is being analysed.

Dimension Table : Stores data about the ways in which the data in the fact table can be analysed.


Fact : products sale
Time Info   product   Customer  Unit sold
8            1          2          10
8            3          1          5
9            1          5          20
10           5          2           3 

Dimension table 

1. Customer Centric
2. Product Centric
3. Time Centric
4. Region Specific
5. Country Specific

Fact and Dimension Tables				Fact,Dimension and sub Dimension
Top-Down Model						Bottom Up Model
Uses More Space					      Uses less Space	
Takes less time for query execution			Takes more time for execution	
Denormalized data						Normalized and also denormalized
Design is simple						Design  is complex
Query complexity is low                         Query complexity is high
Less Foreign Keys						More foreign keys
High Data Redundancy					Less Data Redundancy

Galaxy Schemas: Based on the levels of hierarchy, seperate dimensions are possible
Example : levels like Country, region,state,city etc can very clearly have 4 dimensions resp.
This type of schema can be built by splitting start into many star
helpful in aggregating fact tables for better understanding


ETL : Talend, Informatica, Tableau

Various OLAP Systems
HOLAP - Hybrid OLAP
MOLAP - Multidimensional OLAP
ROLAP - Relational OLAP

Process of moving from finer granular data to coarser data is called as roll up ,and the opposite is called as drill down


Pivot and UnPivot : are operators used to generate multi dimensional report
Pivot is used when we want to transfer row wise data into column wise
UnPivot is used when we want to convert column wise data into row wise

Hierarchial Queries : If using IBMs IMS(Information Management System - a Hierrachial database), then we need not write hierrachial queries. If other databases, then we need to write H-Queries to handle parent-child data for better understanding and reporting

There are basically 3 types of H-Query Syntax for different commercial database

  - connect by  - Oracle SQL, DB2, Postgresql,Informix
  - CTE         - MS SQL
  - ANSI SQL



CTE : Common Table Expression

(with Mycte as(select , where),Mycte.averagemarks)
